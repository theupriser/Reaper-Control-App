### Comparison of transportService.ts and performerStore.ts

After examining both files, I can see that `transportService.ts` and `performerStore.ts` share a significant amount of code, with `performerStore.ts` being an expanded version that includes additional functionality.

#### Similarities (Shared Code)

1. **Core Transport Functions**: Both files share identical implementations of these functions:
    - `safeTransportAction`
    - `startLocalTimer`
    - `stopLocalTimer`
    - `findLengthMarkerInRegion`
    - `extractLengthFromMarker`
    - `formatTime`
    - `formatLongTime`
    - `togglePlay`
    - `nextRegionHandler`
    - `previousRegionHandler`
    - `toggleAutoplayHandler`
    - `toggleCountInHandler`
    - `handleProgressBarClick`
    - `updateTimer`
    - `updateTimerOnRegionChange`

2. **Store Definitions**: Both files define the same core stores:
    - `transportButtonsDisabled`
    - `localTimer`
    - `localPosition`
    - `useLocalTimer`
    - `timerStartTime`
    - `timerStartPosition`
    - `atHardStop`

3. **Derived Stores**: Both files implement the same derived stores for:
    - `nextRegion`
    - `previousRegion`

#### Differences (Unique to performerStore.ts)

1. **Additional Functions**:
    - `handleKeydown`: Keyboard shortcut handling
    - `initializePage`: Page initialization and cleanup

2. **Additional Derived Stores**: `performerStore.ts` includes several additional derived stores:
    - `totalRegionsTime`
    - `elapsedTimeBeforeCurrentRegion`
    - `totalElapsedTime`
    - `totalRemainingTime`
    - `currentSongTime`
    - `songDuration`
    - `songRemainingTime`

3. **Extra State Management**:
    - `currentTime` store for tracking the current time

4. **Enhanced Progress Bar Handling**:
    - `performerStore.ts` has additional code in `handleProgressBarClick` to handle popover state

5. **More Detailed Logging**:
    - The `previousRegion` derived store in `performerStore.ts` has more extensive debug logging

#### Quantitative Comparison

- `transportService.ts`: 799 lines
- `performerStore.ts`: 985 lines
- Shared code: Approximately 750 lines (about 94% of transportService.ts)
- Unique to performerStore.ts: Approximately 235 lines

### Conclusion

The two files are extremely similar, with `performerStore.ts` essentially being an extended version of `transportService.ts`. About 94% of the code in `transportService.ts` is duplicated in `performerStore.ts`. The main differences are that `performerStore.ts` adds performer-specific functionality like keyboard shortcuts, additional derived stores for time calculations, and more detailed logging.

This high level of code duplication suggests that these files could benefit from refactoring to extract the common functionality into a shared module that both could import and extend.
