To add a favicon to the application:

1. Create or obtain a favicon.png file (32x32 pixels is recommended)
2. Place it in this directory (frontend/static)
3. The app.html template is already configured to use it with:
   <link rel="icon" href="%sveltekit.assets%/favicon.png" />

You can also add other static assets like images, fonts, or additional icons in this directory.
