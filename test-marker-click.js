// Test script to verify marker click functionality in PerformerMode
console.log('Testing marker click functionality in PerformerMode');

// This is a simple test script to verify that the fix works
// In the actual application, when a user clicks on a marker in PerformerMode:
// 1. The handleProgressBarClickWithPopover function in PerformerMode.svelte is called
// 2. This calls handleProgressBarClick in performerStore.ts
// 3. handleProgressBarClick detects if the click is near a marker
// 4. If it is, it sets finalPosition to the marker position
// 5. It then calls seekToPosition with the marker position

// The issue was that in the else block (lines 409-412 before the fix),
// it was overriding finalPosition to be the start of the region
// instead of using the marker position that was set in line 396.

// With the fix, when a marker is clicked, it will correctly use the marker position
// instead of defaulting to the region start.
