# Electron Backend Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing the backend in the Electron app for Reaper Control. The backend will be implemented in the main process and will communicate with the renderer process via IPC.

## Main Process Architecture

The main process will be structured as follows:

```
src/main/
├── index.ts                 # Main entry point
├── preload.ts               # Preload script for IPC
├── ipc/
│   ├── ipcHandler.ts        # IPC message handler
│   └── ipcChannels.ts       # IPC channel definitions
├── services/
│   ├── backendService.ts    # Main backend service
│   ├── reaperConnector.ts   # REAPER communication
│   ├── regionService.ts     # Region management
│   ├── markerService.ts     # Marker management
│   ├── midiService.ts       # MIDI input handling
│   └── projectService.ts    # Project management
└── utils/
    ├── logger.ts            # Logging utility
    └── config.ts            # Configuration
```

## REAPER Connector Implementation

The REAPER connector will be responsible for communicating with REAPER through its web interface. It will be implemented as a TypeScript class that provides methods for sending commands to REAPER and receiving responses.

### Key Components

1. **Connection Management**
   - Connect to REAPER web interface
   - Handle connection errors and retries
   - Monitor connection status

2. **Command Handling**
   - Send commands to REAPER
   - Parse responses
   - Handle errors

3. **Data Retrieval**
   - Get regions
   - Get markers
   - Get transport state
   - Get project information

4. **Control Functions**
   - Toggle play/pause
   - Seek to position
   - Seek to region
   - Navigate between regions

## IPC Message Handlers

The IPC message handlers will be responsible for handling messages from the renderer process and sending responses back. They will also emit events to the renderer process when data changes.

### IPC Channels

1. **From Renderer to Main**
   - `ping`: Check connection
   - `refreshRegions`: Refresh regions
   - `refreshMarkers`: Refresh markers
   - `togglePlay`: Toggle play/pause
   - `seekToPosition`: Seek to position
   - `seekToRegion`: Seek to region
   - `nextRegion`: Go to next region
   - `previousRegion`: Go to previous region
   - `seekToCurrentRegionStart`: Seek to current region start
   - `refreshProjectId`: Refresh project ID
   - `reportConnectionStatus`: Report connection status

2. **From Main to Renderer**
   - `regionsUpdate`: Regions updated
   - `markersUpdate`: Markers updated
   - `playbackStateUpdate`: Playback state updated
   - `statusMessage`: Status message
   - `projectIdUpdate`: Project ID updated
   - `projectChanged`: Project changed
   - `midiActivity`: MIDI activity detected
   - `connectionChange`: Connection status changed

### Implementation Approach

The IPC handler will be implemented as a class that:

1. Registers handlers for all incoming messages
2. Delegates to appropriate services
3. Sends responses back to the renderer
4. Emits events to the renderer when data changes

## MIDI Integration

The MIDI service will be responsible for handling MIDI input events and triggering corresponding actions in the application.

### Key Components

1. **Device Management**
   - Detect MIDI devices
   - Connect to MIDI devices
   - Handle device connection/disconnection

2. **Event Handling**
   - Listen for MIDI events
   - Map MIDI events to application actions
   - Trigger actions based on MIDI events

3. **Configuration**
   - Load MIDI configuration
   - Map MIDI notes to actions

### Implementation Approach

The MIDI service will be implemented as a class that:

1. Initializes MIDI input handling
2. Loads configuration from a file
3. Sets up event listeners for MIDI devices
4. Maps MIDI events to application actions
5. Emits events to the renderer process when MIDI activity is detected

## Backend Service Implementation

The backend service will be the main entry point for the backend functionality. It will initialize all other services and coordinate between them.

### Key Components

1. **Service Initialization**
   - Initialize REAPER connector
   - Initialize region service
   - Initialize marker service
   - Initialize MIDI service
   - Initialize project service

2. **Event Coordination**
   - Forward events between services
   - Emit events to the renderer process

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle errors from services
   - Report errors to the renderer process

### Implementation Approach

The backend service will be implemented as a class that:

1. Initializes all services
2. Sets up event listeners between services
3. Handles errors from services
4. Provides a clean API for the IPC handler to use

## Next Steps

1. Implement the REAPER connector
2. Implement the region service
3. Implement the marker service
4. Implement the MIDI service
5. Implement the project service
6. Implement the backend service
7. Implement the IPC handler
8. Test the implementation
9. Document the implementation
