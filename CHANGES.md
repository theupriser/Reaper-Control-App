# Fixed Width Connection Status Indicator

## Latest Changes (2025-08-01)

1. Fixed the issue where the connection status indicator was changing width due to varying text length
2. Set a fixed width (250px) for the entire ConnectionStatus component
3. Added fixed width (110px) for the dynamic text elements (ping time, latency)
4. Implemented text overflow handling with ellipsis for long text
5. Ensured labels don't shrink when container width changes

## Implementation Details

The `ConnectionStatus.svelte` component has been updated with:
- Changed from `max-width: 300px` to a fixed `width: 250px` to ensure consistent dimensions
- Added fixed width (110px) to the ping-value, latency-value, and error-value elements
- Added text-align: right to align values consistently
- Implemented overflow handling (text-overflow: ellipsis) for long text values
- Added flex-shrink: 0 to labels to prevent them from shrinking

These changes ensure the connection status indicator maintains a consistent width regardless of the content displayed, particularly the "Last ping" status text which can vary significantly in length (from "Just now" to "X minutes ago").

# Previous Connection Status Indicator Update

## Changes Made

1. Removed the `LatencyIndicator` component from the main page layout
2. Repositioned the `ConnectionStatus` component to the uppermost right corner of the page
3. Updated the styling of the `ConnectionStatus` component to use fixed positioning
4. Added responsive CSS to hide the connection status on mobile devices

## Implementation Details

### ConnectionStatus Component Updates

The `ConnectionStatus.svelte` component has been updated with:
- Fixed positioning to appear in the top-right corner of the viewport (position: fixed)
- Coordinates set to top: 10px, right: 10px to position it in the uppermost right corner
- Semi-transparent background (rgba(42, 42, 42, 0.8)) to match the previous styling
- Z-index of 1000 to ensure it appears above other elements
- Media query to hide it completely on mobile devices (screen width <= 768px)

### Page Layout Changes

The main page layout in `+page.svelte` has been updated:
- Removed the import for the `LatencyIndicator` component
- Removed the `LatencyIndicator` component from the template
- Kept the `ConnectionStatus` component in the header section, but it now appears in the uppermost right corner due to its fixed positioning

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- The connection status appears in the top-right corner on desktop
- The connection status is hidden on mobile devices
- All connection information (status, latency, last ping time) is displayed correctly
- The reconnect button appears when disconnected

## Comparison with Previous Implementation

This change replaces the previous implementation where:
- Only the latency was shown in the uppermost right corner
- The full connection status was shown in the header section

Now, the complete connection status information (including latency) is shown in the uppermost right corner, providing more comprehensive information at a glance while maintaining a clean interface on mobile devices.
